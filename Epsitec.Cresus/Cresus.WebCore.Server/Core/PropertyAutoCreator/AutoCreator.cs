	/// <summary>
	/// This class is used as a factory to create entities that are referenced by other. For
	/// instance, if we have a Person entity with a Comment field, we can use an AutoCreator that
	/// will be used to instantiates Comments and put them in the appropriate Person property.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// An AutoCreator is fully defined by the lambda expression that represents the entity
	/// property that it targets. In addition, they have an id, so that this id can be given to
	/// the client and the corresponding AutoCreator can be find back later on, only based on its
	/// id.
	/// An AutoCreator is not bound to an entity. They are general factories that can be used for
	/// all entities of the same type. The entity on which to apply the AutoCreator is given as an
	/// argument to the Execute(...) method.
	/// The Execute(...) method is thread safe.
	/// </remarks>

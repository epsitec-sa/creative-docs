There are two .bat scripts in this project :

- jscheck.bat whose purpose is to staticaly analyse the javacript files in this
  project, in order to check if they are properly formatted and if they contain
  simple mistakes or dangerous code.

- jsfix.bat whose purpose is to automatically correct potential mistakes that
  are found by jscheck.bat.

These scripts need two external tools:

- google closure linter. This tool is available here :
  https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/. There are instructions
  somewhere on this website to install it. Basically the involve the following
  steps:
  1) install python. I installed the 32 bits version as it makes the following
     step easier. It can be downloaded here :
     http://www.python.org/download/windows/.
  2) install the easy_install module for python. It can be downloaded here :
     http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install.
  3) install google closure linter using the easy_install module. I installed
     the version 2.3.5 as the last one (2.3.6) does not work on windows.
  
- jshint. This tool is available here : http://www.jshint.com/. To install it,
  to the following steps:
  1) download the tools somewhere on your machine.
  2) create a .bat file called jshint.bat in the directory where it is installed
    with the following content: @CScript //NoLogo "%~dp0\env\wsh.js" %*

Finaly, you must add the two directories where google closure linter and where
jshint are installed to you PATH environment variable.

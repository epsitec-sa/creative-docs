Merge PVK and SPC into single PFX file
--------------------------------------

pvk2pfx -pvk opac.pvk    -pi ... -spc opac.spc    -pfx opac.pfx 
pvk2pfx -pvk epsitec.pvk -pi ... -spc epsitec.spc -pfx epsitec.pfx 


Import the PFX file into the Certificate Store, simply double-click
on the PFX files and follow the wizard.

On Vista, it is best to use the certmgr.exe tool to import the *.pfx
certificates into the store, then delete the *.pfx files (which are
not protected while on disk).

Use SignTool.exe instead of SignCode.exe to sign the binaries.

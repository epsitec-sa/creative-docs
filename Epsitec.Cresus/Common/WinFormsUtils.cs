		/// both in the same executable whose main method is decoradted with the [STAThread]
		/// attribute and use win forms. But the server app is not a win forms application, in the
		/// sense that it doesn't create any form and waits until it is closed. This behavior
		/// blocks the message pump and Visual Studio complains that there is a Context Switch
		/// Deadlock because it thinks that the application is not responding. This method can be
		/// used to launch the server on its own thread without blocking the main thread, so that
		/// the message pump is not blocked, and thus Visual Studio is happy.
